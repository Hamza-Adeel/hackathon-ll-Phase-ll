## PROMPT

Generate SPEC-4 — ERROR FIXING & SYSTEM INTEGRATION Review and validate the complete implementation of Spec-1 (Backend), Spec-2 (Frontend), and Spec-3 (Authentication + UI). Identify and fix all errors related to backend, frontend, database, authentication, UI styling, and integration. Ensure the backend is fully integrated with the frontend, authentication flow is correct, and the overall project is stable and production-ready.

## RESPONSE

Specification `004-system-integration-fixes` created. The new branch `004-system-integration-fixes` is now active.

The specification outlines the requirements for a full system review, including end-to-end testing, error fixing, and UI polishing. It defines user stories for validation, functional requirements for bug resolution and integration, and measurable success criteria to ensure the application is production-ready. A validation checklist has also been created.

Ready for `/sp.plan`.
